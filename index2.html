					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: brown; font-weight: 600; font-family: cursive;">My dearest Shaina,</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: brown; font-family: cursive; font-size: 15px;">Happy 7 years of our togetherness!</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: brown; padding-bottom: 20px; font-family: cursive; font-size: 15px;">This unending journey of life has made me a human who has learned to love. Being able to live my life to the fullest by your side has been an overwhelming experience that I wish to continue till my last breath. I had never imagined my life to take a turn to an unexpected path of love and relationship. Unexpected experiences are the most memorable ones. Our relationship has grown from a seed to a sapling. The love, care, respect and trust have together strengthened the roots. Let us continue nurturing the sapling, for it to grow into a memorable tree of admiration.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: brown; font-family: cursive; font-size: 15px;">Always and forever,</p>

					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: white; font-size: 18px; font-family: cursive;">
						Beginings are always beautiful. Who knew that the begining would be so unexpected too. We never know what turn our 
						lives can take at a certain point. Be it a path of discomfort and darkness or an aesthetic path of love and 
						pleasure, we are bound to follow it. The almighty had decided to direct me to a path of love, care and affection.
						A teenager who never believed in the above mentioned theories, fell in the pit of love. Converging to the path of a girl
						like you was beyond my dreams. I still try to find that force which made me approach you. For such a shy teenager, approaching
						you was never a thought to ponder upon. Our story started with an uncertain fate. Both of us being shy, hesitant, sceptical
						and reserved. The doors of comfort and trust were visible after few months.

						The first two years were tough. Restrictions, insecurities, privacy and limitations were the hurdles standing on our
						path. Being the newbies and immature teenagers, we found ourselves stuck between the barriers surrounding us.
						Mistakes were made from my side and I'm still apologetic for that. Few months of ignorance and unwanted distancing by
						me created a void in between. Seeing you and exchanging words had become my habit I could barely resist. The void 
						had the essence of love. All the actions have a strong reason behind which we fail to see. Distancing from you had 
						the one which made me realise your importance. The immature decision proved to be the reason behind the present 
						maturity. I still laugh remembering those days of innocence and silliness. We have grown from the very beginning.
						We have faced diverse situations and held each other on every step of our unending stairs.

						The first decisive year of my career had arrived and you were the solid pillar backing me up. Our love was 
						at a growing phase and we could see a brighter future together. Unfortunately my first career dream remained a dream
						for me. Despite all my efforts, I could not convert that dream into reality. Failure was the only word surrounding
						my mind. There was a pillar which did not let my strength collapse. Yes, you were the strongest pillar I could depend upon for 
						solace. The year which made me fall for you with all my heart. The love deepened and I was assured that I could do
						the impossible with your presence in my life. The strength you helped me build has made me a man of rigidity and 
						diligence. Today, if I have the courage to dream high, the credit goes to you, my love. Bringing me back from a 
						dormant state and giving me reasons to live fearlessly, I owe you something that I can never pay you back.
						Your selfless love and care is beyond any pleasures of life. The smile your face carries is beyond all the wonders
						of the world. You are the only reason, I smile through all the hurdles in my life.

				<div class="story">
					<p style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; color: black; font-size: 18px; font-family: cursive;">
						For the first time in 3 years, I understood what distancing from loved ones feels like. Missing someone was never
						a feeling I experienced. One complete year was a testing phase of our so called long distance relationship. Many
						unwanted thoughts crossed my mind. We fought, we cried, we made mistakes and we hurt each other, but the only
						constant was the 'love'. Loving each other was never kept aside. After all habits are not meant to be forgotten.
						A phase in relationship that often escalates negativity and results in a harsh ending. A year of mixture of 
						emotions and misunderstandings often caught us in a locked room of uncertainities. The purity of love always
						finds a solution to overcome the most difficult situations and that was exactly what we experienced. Succeeding in
						the test of bond, we emerged stronger than ever. It was our love that came on top of all the disparities.

						Last 3 years have been the most important phase of our relationship. From one year of missing each other, to 
						living in same city for next 3 years, the almighty rewarded us for our pure love for each other. Living the best 
						time of my life in thse 3 years, I have loved to even more. We have taken mature decisions, we have cared for each
						other, we have fought, we have cried, but most importantly we have loved each other. The jokes we have cracked, the 
						places we have been together, the laugh we have shared and the mistakes we have committed, all of these have contributes
						to our growth. The tree has been growing towards prosperity. We have lived to the fullest and expressed ourselves
						the most. I promise you that I'll fulfil every dream we have seen together. I promise you that I'll live up to the 
						expectations you have from me. I promise you that I will keep loving you the way I have. I promise you that I'll 
						be by your side whenever you will need me. I promise you that I'll give you all the happiness you deserve. 
						<br><br>
						Cheers to 7 years of our relationship with a hope to continue till our last breath.
						<br><br>
						I love you sweetheart!
